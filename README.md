## About This Portfolio

A living collection of self-contained case studies across **data science, data analytics, data engineering, software engineering, mathematical modeling, and applied research**. Every project is independently installable, tested, and reproducible — each one built to solve a concrete problem with whatever tools the domain actually demands.

Case studies span quantitative finance, computational physics, structural biology, macroeconomics, product analytics, philosophy, and more.

## Data Sovereignty Philosophy

Rather than waiting for access to production data, this portfolio demonstrates **proactive data sovereignty**: designing and generating realistic synthetic datasets that mirror operational reality. This proves:

- Deep domain understanding — realistic distributions, seasonal patterns, edge cases
- Ability to work autonomously and deliver value from day one
- Statistical rigor in modeling scenarios before having real data

*"I don't need someone to hand me the data. I design the scenario to test the model."*

## About

**Mario Casanova — Mexico City**

I enjoy building things. Most of what's in this repo started as a thing I wanted to understand and then turned into code. Continental philosophy, derivatives, protein geometry, SaaS retention — those aren't the same field, but they hide the same shape: a structure to learn, a method to pick, an output that has to actually work. I'm not trying to specialize in one of them, I'm trying to specialize in getting through any of them.

**Why this portfolio exists**

Two reasons. First, these are problems I genuinely enjoy thinking about — the repo is where I park what I learn so I don't lose it. Second, I'm building toward sharing knowledge and being able to showcase how I can help. If you're hiring or contracting someone to solve a real problem in your data, this is what I look like when I'm working on my own — feel free to call.

**Why I build**

A lot of industries have a "bullshit problem" — people throwing around terms they don't really understand about things they understand even less, mostly to look smart. I don't have time for that. The work in this repo goes in the other direction: pick a hard topic, do the math openly, show the code, ship the plot. I publish only things that I can reproduce. If I can't explain what the model is doing, the model isn't done, yet.
